/**
 * @brief Provides Rust-style panic functionality for immediate program termination on unrecoverable errors.
 * @details
 * This namespace provides macros and functions to handle unrecoverable errors in C++ code.
 * It imitate Rust's \c panic! macro behavior, allowing the program to immediately exit with error information and stack traces.
 *
 * After writing programs in Rust, I deeply realized the necessity of handling errors immediately.
 * When encountering unrecoverable errors, the program should exit immediately and report the error, which ensures program robustness.
 * Therefore, I introduced this namespace and implemented macros and functions equivalent to Rust's \c panic! macro.
 * 
 * Unfortunately, I cannot change the exception mechanism in the standard library.
 * The standard library will still throw exceptions where it does, and I cannot prevent that.
 * Therefore, I suggest a good practice that any C++ exception should be immediately treated as an error and cause the program to crash and exit.
 * For this reason, registering any unhandled error callbacks which may resume the execution of program is prohibited to prevent unexpected continuation of execution.
 * For code we write ourselves that we can control, we should use the macros provided in this file instead of throwing exceptions.
 * In this way, unexpected behavior in our code will cause the program to exit immediately, outputting error information and stack traces.
 * Standard library exceptions will also cause the program to exit, but without stack information.
